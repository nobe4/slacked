> [!NOTE]
> Early stage, sorry for the terrible code.

This work is heavily relying on the amazing [`gh-slack`](https://github.com/rneatherway/gh-slack).
Go give it a :star:!

## Install

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nobe4/slacked/releases).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The app is currently not signed, and on macOS you might need to run:
> `xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine path/to/slacked.app`

## Use

- select a message from slack
- copy its link: of the format `https://<org>.slack.com/archives/<id>/<id>`
- paste it into the input field with the placeholder `slack url`
- click `archive`
- click `copy`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On the first run, the app might ask you to unlock your macOS keychain (or
> equivalent in other OS), this is needed to access your Slack token and should
> be done only once.
